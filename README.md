# Insider-Trades-Fetch
A Python project for smarter investing. The main script, fetch_insider_trades, connects to Finnhub, letting users set a time window (as recent as ~3 business days) and filters for companies or trades, caching results. analyze_insider_trades cleans the CSV into a formatted, customized dataset for quick insights.
